# PowerBIbasic

I worked on the "Kevin Cookie Company Orders" sample dataset (secondary) as my first step in understanding the fundamentals of Power BI. I've made a Filled Map as a simple task, and it has the State attribute from the Customer Table along with the Card values of the total Revenue and the total Cookies Shipped. Depending on the state we are navigating, different card values represent the total amount of cookies shipped and income.
